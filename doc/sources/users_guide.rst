Tasks

Creating Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first thing you must do is add one or more tasks.  Tasks are unique
names given to an activity or project.  A task is referenced by it's
name, so it's best to keep that name as short but memorable.  Tasks also
may have a longer description associated with them that will be shown
along with the task in the task list.  The description is optional, and
is only used for your reference when listing tasks.


To create a task, use the command `create`::

    $> tt create project1 "longer description of project 1"

The `create` command takes the parameters `name` and `description`

   * `name` -- A required short identifier for the task
   * `description` -- An optional description for reference

Listing Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To view the current task list use the command `tasks`::

    $> tt tasks

The `tasks` command will output a table showing the task names and
descriptions.

Renaming Task
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change the name of a task, use the command `rename`::

    $> tt rename old new

The `rename` command takes the parameters `old_name` and `new_name`

    * `old_name` -- The name of an existing task
    * `new_name` -- The new task name

The `new_name` value must be a unique name for the new task.   All
records in associated with the old task name will be updated
automatically to use the new name.

Updating a Task's Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to change the long description for an existing task, you can
use the `describe` command to do so::

    $> tt describe my_task "A new description of my task"

The `describe` command takes the parameters `name` and `description`.

    * `name` -- The name of an existing task
    * `description` -- The new description of the task.  Specifying the
      empty string "" will erase an existing description.

Deleting a Task
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to remove a task *only* if the task has not been
associated with any timer events.  Once the task has been used, it is
**permanent**.

To remove an unused task, use the `remove` command::

    $> tt remove my_task

The `remove` command takes the parameter `name`:

    * `name` -- The name of an existing, unused, task

Timers
------

Starting a Timer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you wish to start a timer for a task, use the `start` command::

    $> tt start my_task

The `start` command takes one required parameter `task` and one optional
parameter `timestamp`.

    * `task` -- The name of an existing task.
    * `timestamp` -- Optional time when the task was started.  This
      value must be in the past, and uses a flexible format described
      below.

The `timestamp` parameter is fairly flexible in it's notation.  Below
are some examples which could be used.  Keep in mind, that the `start`
command requires that any provided timestamps be in the past.  It is
**not** possible to start a timer in the future.

  * "2018-02-14T09:00:00-0400"
  * "February 14 at 9am EDT"
  * "Today at 9am EDT"
  * "Yesterday at 9am EDT"
  * "9am"
  * "09:00"
  * "Monday at 3am UTC"

Stopping a Timer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since only one timer can be active at a given time, it's not necessary
to tell the `stop` command what timer to stop, however, it will take an
optional parameter containing the `timestamp` in the same format as was
used by `start` if you wish to stop a timer at an earlier time, such as
if you forgot to stop the timer and realized it later.

To stop the active timer, use the `stop` command::

    $> tt stop

Stop takes only the optional `timestamp` field.

    * `timestamp` -- Optional time when the task was stopped.  This
      value **must** be in the past, and uses the flexible format
      describe in the `start` command.

Reporting
---------

There are several options available when it comes to reporting.  The
first and most basic is to simply view the raw records, the second,
shows the total accumlative time spent per-task, and the third gives a
montly view showing the accumulated time per task per day.

Showing Timers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To show a table of the individual records for a given timespan use the
`records` command::

    $> tt records --begin "Monday at midnight" --end "now"

The options `--begin` and `--end` take optional timestamp strings, to
limit the list of records to only those within a given range.  The
`--begin` option is inclusive while the `--end` option is not.  If not
provided, they default to showing the records for the current week.

The table will contain the following columns for each record:

   * Id -- The internal ID for the timer record
   * Task -- The name of the associated task
   * Start -- The timestamp when the timer was started (in the current
     timezone)
   * Stop -- The timestamp when the timer was stopped, if the timer was
     stopped.
   * Elapsed -- Either the duration of the timer if it has been stopped
     or the current elapsed time if it is active.

An example of the output is as follows:

+-----+---------+----------------------+---------------------+-----------+
| ID  |  Task   |  Start               |  Stop               |  Elapsed  |
+-----+---------+----------------------+---------------------+-----------+
| 12  |  foo    |  2018-02-04 09:00:00 | 2018-02-04 11:35:00 |     02:35 |
+-----+---------+----------------------+---------------------+-----------+
| 13  |  bar    |  2018-02-04 11:40:00 | 2018-02-04 12:00:00 |     00:20 |
+-----+---------+----------------------+---------------------+-----------+
| 14  |  foo    |  2018-02-04 12:00:00 | 2018-02-04 17:35:00 |     05:35 |
+-----+---------+----------------------+---------------------+-----------+

Showing Task Totals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To show a table of the accumulated total time spent on each task during
a given timespan use the `summary` command::

    $> tt summary --begin "Monday at midnight" --end "now"

This takes the same `--begin` and `--end` optional timestamps as the
`records` command, and will limit the timers used in the calculation to
only those records which were started between these timers.  The
`--begin` option is inclusive while the `--end` option is not.  If not
provided, they default to showing the totals for the current week.

The table will contain the following columns for each task:

    * Task -- The name of the task
    * Elapsed -- The total time of all timers within the timespan,
      including the elapsed time of any running timers.

An example of the output is as follows:

+--------+-----------+
| Task   |   Elapsed |
+--------+-----------+
| foo    |    02:52  |
+--------+-----------+
| bar    |    11:03  |
+--------+-----------+
| baz    |    00:15  |
+--------+-----------+
| TOTAL  |    14:35  |
+--------+-----------+


Showing Monthly Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The monthly report will break down a month into weeks, showing one grid
per week, where the rows represent the tasks worked on during that week,
and the columns are one-per-weekday within the week.  The final column
shows the accumulated total per task for the week, and the final row in
each table shows the accumulated total of all timers per day.  The
bottom right value, represents the total hours worked across all tasks
in a given week.

To show the monthly report, use the `report` command::

    $> tt report --month 2

The `report` command takes an optional `--month` argument with the month
number.  For example to show the report for February use `--month 2`  If
the given month number is greater than the current month, it will report
on that month in the previous year.  For example if it is currently
February of 2018, specifying `--month 2` will report Febuary 2018, while
`--month 3` will report on March of 2017.  It is not possible to report
on a month more than 1 year ago, nor is it possible to report on a month
in the future.

An example of the reporting output is:

+---------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------+
| Tasks   | Feb 05 | Feb 06 | Feb 07 | Feb 08 | Feb 09 | Total |
+---------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------+
| foo     |  06:00 |  00:15 |        |        |        | 06:15 |
+---------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------+
| bar     |        |  03:00 |        |        |        | 03:00 |
+---------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------+
| TOTAL   |  06:00 |  03:15 |        |        |        | 09:15 |
+---------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------+


Showing Status Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On any given day, it is possible to view the status reporting for that day by
issuing the `status` command.  The `status` command does not take any arguments.

To show today's status report use the `status` command::

    $> tt status

An example of the reporting output is:

+---------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------+
| Tasks   | Feb 05 | Feb 06 | Feb 07 | Feb 08 | Feb 09 | Total |
+---------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------+
| foo     |  06:00 |  08:05 |        |        |        | 08:05 |
+---------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------+
| bar     |        |  00:20 |        |        |        | 00:20 |
+---------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------+
| TOTAL   |  06:00 |  03:15 |        |        |        | 09:15 |
+---------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------+

|

+-----+---------+----------------------+---------------------+-----------+
| ID  |  Task   |  Start               |  Stop               |  Elapsed  |
+-----+---------+----------------------+---------------------+-----------+
| 12  |  foo    |  2018-02-06 09:00:00 | 2018-02-06 11:35:00 |     02:35 |
+-----+---------+----------------------+---------------------+-----------+
| 13  |  bar    |  2018-02-06 11:40:00 | 2018-02-06 12:00:00 |     00:20 |
+-----+---------+----------------------+---------------------+-----------+
| 14  |  foo    |  2018-02-06 12:00:00 | 2018-02-06 17:35:00 |     05:35 |
